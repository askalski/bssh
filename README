This implementation is a work in progress (when I have time). The plan is to
implement base protocol as defined in RFC, plus one or more most popular 
extensions provided by OpenSSH (as original authentication methods are
considered obsolete). I plan to implement OpenSSH's config file format in proper
time, but will not follow the output/logging/debug formats.

At this time, client and server programs are not functional, and for testing
purposes only. Main development effort happens in bsshlib.
